# Historical overview


## Evolution by natural selection

<br>

*"To my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, ants making slaves, the larvae of ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings; namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die."*

Darwin, *The Origin of Species*

## Natural selection and genetic variation

- How much of the genome is subject to natural selection?
- Which parts are affected? What do they do?
- How does natural selection affect genetic variation?

## Selectionism vs neutralism

- Most genetic variation is neutral or deleterious
- Most genetic variation is positively selected

**Who is right?**

## Selectionism vs neutralism

*"The neutralists think - rightly in my opinion - that adaptations are the tip of the iceberg: probably most evolutionary change, when seen at the molecular level, is non-functional."*

Richard Dawkins, *The Blind Watchmaker*

# Natural selection in the (population) genomic era | Can we find the tips of the iceberg?



## Natural selection in the (population) genomic era

(Or, what can more markers tell us about natural selection?)

We can take two approaches...

- Identify the genetic basis of known adaptive traits (top-down approaches)
- Identify loci under selection, then see what they do (bottom-up approaches)


## Bottom-up approaches to detecting selection

## Bottom-up approaches to detecting selection

```{r,warning = F,fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4,fig.align = "center"}
stat <- rbeta(5000,2,10)/10

peak <- sample(seq(0,0.2,length.out = 50),50)
stat[seq(2001,2100,length.out = 50)] <- stat[seq(2001,2100,length.out = 50)] + peak
pos <- c(1:5000)
dd <- data.frame(Statistic = stat,Position = pos)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dd,aes(x = Position,y = Statistic))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

## Detecting selection within populations

$iHS$

Integrated haplotype score

The amount of extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) at a given SNP along the ancestral allele relative to the derived allele.
