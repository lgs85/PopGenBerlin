#Historical overview







## Darwin and genetic diversity

**Darwin’s four postulates in the Origin of Species (1859)**

<div class = "columns-2">

1. Individuals within species are variable
2. Some variations are passed on to offspring
3. In every generation more offspring are produced than can survive
4. Individuals who survive and go on to reproduce are are naturally selected.

## Darwin and heritable variation

- Natural selection based on heritable variation within populations
- Darwin believed in blending inheritance
- But this leads to homgenisation

## Particulate inheritance

Gregor Mendel (1866): three“laws”

- Individuals possess two alleles at each gene
- Genes for separate traits are passed on independently
- Recessive alleles are masked by dominance alleles
